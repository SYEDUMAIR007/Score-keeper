# Score-keeper
It is a simple application which can be used to keep the record of scores in a game.
I created it using 
HTML 5
CSS 3
Java script
I created this to test my DOM knowledge.
Features include:

1. Adding Team names (Automatically changes button names as team names).

2. Selecting winning score (Max score)

3. Selecting game(Changes background and adds images of the respective game selected).

4. Reset.
